# Instead Annotation Engine

A configurable annotation engine that maps structured taxpayer data to IRS tax forms using a JSON-based annotation specification.

This project was developed as part of the **Instead Engineer Technical Assessment**.

---

# Problem Statement

Taxpayer information is typically stored as structured JSON, while IRS tax forms are fixed PDF templates containing predefined fields.

The objective of this project is to design a reusable annotation specification that acts as a contract between taxpayer data and a PDF rendering engine, allowing values to be accurately rendered onto IRS forms without hardcoding field positions inside application code.

---

# Solution Overview

The solution consists of a configurable annotation specification and a modular rendering pipeline.
